### Becoming
You become what you repeat every day. Inversely, you will not become what you do not practice regularly.

### Elections
We cannot expect people to do a thorough evaluation of the alternative candidates every time there is an election. This means that who people vote for depends on a host of other factors (personal situations, fears, brand affinity, partial information on some of the candidates, one or two specific policies...). This sounds suboptimal from a rational perspective, but is it possible that it introduces some beneficial randomness that keeps excessive social control at bay?

### Indifference
Most of the harm we do as humans is not due to cruelty, but rather to indifference.

### Paradox
We tend to feel uncomfortable when facing paradoxes, but they seem to capture the world much better than clear-cut conclusions.
