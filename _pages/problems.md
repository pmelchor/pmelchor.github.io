We are just one of the many species that have evolved on planet Earth. The Earth was not given to us and does not belong to us. However, we are more intelligent than the other species. We have much more creative power and much more destructive power. While we are busy thinking about our jobs, the economy, politics, sports, romance, and social networks, this is happening:

- Climate change

- Human-inflicted animal suffering

- Pollution

- Poverty-related suffering

I plan to write about each of these problems and other issues like existential risks. In the meantime, I recommend you read 80,000 Hours' [list of the most urgent global problems](https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/).
